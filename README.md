# Voxtulate Client
An unofficial Voxiom.io client, designed for true Voxtulators

### Client Safety 
All Voxtulate Client source code is publicly available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/robertpakalns/VoxtulateClient). If you have concerns about the safety of your private information while using the Voxtulate Client, feel free to inspect the source code. Trust in the client is based on your trust in the developer.

### Development Questions (Electron.js)
- Renderer processes automatically set `description` name instead of `build.productName` from `package.json`. The name `Voxtulate Client` looks better than `Unofficial Voxiom client, for real Voxtulators`.
- `disabling mouse acceleration is not supported` message from `https://voxiom.io/package/c88d6619469a22a797eb.js` script while clicking on in-game canvas.
- I would like to rewrite the whole client using Tauri. The only problem I get there is FPS uncap. If I resolve this issue, I will definitely move on Tauri.
