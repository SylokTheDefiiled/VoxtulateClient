# Voxtulate Client
An unofficial Voxiom.io client, for real Voxtulators

### Current Features
- Adblocker
- Unlimited FPS
- Custom crosshair
- CSS/JS customization
- Client side CSS/JS customization
- Settings window (press F1 to open)
- Chromium developer tools (press F12 to open)
- Minimized console (FPS, coordinates, and latency)

### Future features
- Better client side side CSS/JS
- Resouce swapper
- Advanced inventory sorting
- Key binding options for client features
- Automatically apply client settings without relaunching

### Development questions
- How to automatically toggle settings without relaunching the client? The question concerns features that theoretically should not require a relaunch.
- Renderer processes automatically set `description` name instead of `build.productName` from `package.json`. The name `Voxtulate Client` looks better than `Unofficial Voxiom client, for real Voxtulators`.
